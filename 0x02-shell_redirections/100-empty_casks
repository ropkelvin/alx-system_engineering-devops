# This script finds all empty files and directories in the current directory and its subdirectories.
# It then extracts the names of these empty files and directories.
# The 'find . -empty' command searches for empty files and directories.
# The 'rev' command reverses the characters in each line of the output.
# The 'cut -d '/' -f 1' command extracts the first field (which is the reversed name) from the reversed path.
# The final 'rev' command reverses the characters again to get the original names of the empty files and directories.
find . -empty | rev | cut -d '/' -f 1 | rev
