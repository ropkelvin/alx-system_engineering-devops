# This script extracts the username and home directory fields from the /etc/passwd file,
# then sorts the output alphabetically by username.
# - `cut -d: -f1,6 /etc/passwd` extracts the first (username) and sixth (home directory) fields
#   from each line of the /etc/passwd file, using ':' as the delimiter.
# - `sort` sorts the extracted fields alphabetically by the username.
