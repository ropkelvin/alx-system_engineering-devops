# This script processes input data to find the top 10 most frequent lines (excluding the header).
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. `tail -n +2`: Skips the first line of the input (header).
# 2. `cut -f -1`: Extracts the first field from each line.
# 3. `sort -k 1`: Sorts the lines based on the first field.
# 4. `uniq -c`: Counts the occurrences of each unique line.
# 5. `sort -rnk 1`: Sorts the lines in reverse numerical order based on the count.
# 6. `head -n 11`: Selects the top 11 lines (including the header).
# 7. `rev`: Reverses the characters in each line.
# 8. `cut -d ' ' -f -1`: Extracts the first field from each reversed line.
# 9. `rev`: Reverses the characters in each line back to the original order.
