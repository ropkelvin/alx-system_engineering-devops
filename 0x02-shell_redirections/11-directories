#!/bin/bash
# This script counts the number of directories (excluding the current directory)
# in the current directory and its subdirectories.
# - `find . -mindepth 1 -type d` lists all directories starting from the current directory (.)
#   but excludes the current directory itself (due to -mindepth 1).
# - `| wc -l` pipes the output of the find command to `wc -l`, which counts the number of lines,
#   effectively giving the number of directories found.
find . -mindepth 1 -type d | wc -l
